# Specification Quality Checklist: Sidecar Artifact Preparation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-07
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] Specification defines observable behavior or objective technical outcomes
- [x] Product specs avoid unnecessary implementation details; technical specs include explicit technologies only when justified by issue, repository evidence, constitution, or approved decision
- [x] Focused on user/business value for product behavior or technical/operational value for enabling work
- [x] Written for the intended reviewers: product stakeholders for behavior features, technical reviewers for enabling work
- [x] All mandatory sections completed or intentionally adapted to the feature shape

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable and objectively verifiable
- [x] Success criteria avoid unapproved implementation detail
- [x] Acceptance scenarios appropriate to the feature shape are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Observable UI or user-observable behavior changes define visible states, messages, interaction outcomes, navigation/focus behavior, i18n-visible text, responsive/mobile behavior, and role-dependent visibility where applicable — N/A: no UI or user-observable application behavior changes
- [x] Validation-sensitive behavior includes a proportional input/state matrix, or is marked N/A with a reason — N/A: the feature changes repository workflow instructions, not runtime input validation or state transitions
- [x] Correctness-sensitive technical behavior identifies the responsible evidence layer
- [x] No unresolved major Open Questions remain; if any remain, feature is explicitly reported as blocked
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] Product functional requirements or technical requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] Product user scenarios or technical acceptance scenarios cover primary behavior/workflow
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] Specification does not include unapproved implementation detail

## Notes

- Initial validation passes. This is a technical/enabling workflow feature scoped to the sidecar coordinator skill from #226 and artifact path rules from #225.
